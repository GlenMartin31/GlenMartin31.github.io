	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<p> I'm a Lecturer in Health Data Science in the <a href="https://www.herc.ac.uk/">Centre for Health Informatics</a> at 
	the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>.</p>

	<p> I am a statitician with research interests in the field of prognostic modelling. This is an exciting area of research that aims to use 
	mathematical models to predict the risk of certain (health) outcomes or events in individuals based on a set of characteristics about them (e.g. their age and gender). 
	I have particular interests in cardiovascular disease and surgery, and have developed a prognostic model to predict the risk of dealth following a heart valve operation
	<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2017-312489">(details here)</a>. I am particularly interested in the statistical methodology that underpins these models to improve the 
	ways in which they are developed (and tested) ready for clinical use.</p>
