		<p> I'm a Lecturer in Health Data Science in the <a href="https://www.herc.ac.uk/">Centre for Health Informatics</a> at 
		the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>. My main research interests focus on the field of prognostic modelling 
		(a.k.a risk prediction modelling). This is an exciting area of research that aims to use mathematical models to predict the risk of certain (health) 
		outcomes occuring for individuals based on a set of characteristics about them (e.g. their age and gender). My work focusses on developing methodology to 
		help improve the ways in which risk prediction models are developed (and tested/validated) for clinical use.</p>
		
		<p>This website contains a collection of my work, such as selected publications, a description of main <a href="/projects">projects</a>, that I lead on, 
		and a collection of <a href="/posts">posts</a> that aim to summarise my papers, or discuss topics of interest to me (and hopefully you too).

	<h2>Research Interests</h2>
	<p>My research focusses on risk prediction modelling. Here, the idea is to use data to build mathematical models that take a set of relevant characteristics or features
	as inputs and output a risk or probability of some event happening in the future. For example, there are models to predict (or forecast) what the weather is going to do tomorrow. 
	Here, the models have been developed (or trained) based on current understandings of different meteorological phenomenon and using historical data. As a health data scientist, 
	my research focusses on health contexts, but the same general idea applies: we can use historical health data to relate the experiences of past patients to aim to make predictions about risk of 
	likely outcomes in future patients. Such risk models can be used to support clinical decision-making. Clearly, this means that any such risk models should be robustly developed and
	tested, which is where my research focusses: improving the methodology that are used to develop (and test) the risk models.</p>
