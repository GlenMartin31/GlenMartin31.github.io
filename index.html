	<p> I'm a Lecturer in Health Data Science in the <a href="https://www.herc.ac.uk/">Centre for Health Informatics</a> at 
	the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>. My main research interests focus on the field of prognostic modelling 
	(risk prediction modelling). This is an exciting area of research that aims to use data to build mathematical models that take a set of relevant 
	characteristics or features as inputs and output a risk or probability of some event happening in the future. For example, there are models to predict 
	(or forecast) what the weather is likely to do tomorrow. Here, the models have been developed (or trained) based on current understandings of different 
	meteorological phenomenon and using historical data.</p>
	<p>Now, as a health data scientist, my research focusses on health contexts, but the same general idea applies: we can use historical health data to 
	develop models that aim to make predictions about risk of likely outcomes in future patients based on a set of characteristics (e.g. their age and 
	gender). Such risk models can be used to support clinical decision-making. Clearly, this means that any such risk models should be robustly developed 
	and tested, which is where my research focus is centred: to improve the methodologies that are used to develop (and test) risk models.</p>
	
	<p>This website contains a collection of my work, such as selected <a href="/publications">publications</a>, a description of my main <a href="/projects">projects</a>, 
	and a collection of <a href="/posts">posts</a> that aim to summarise my papers or discuss topics of interest to me (and hopefully you too).
