<h2>Towards Approaches for Multi-Outcome Risk Prediction </h2>
<h3>2020 - 2023 </h3>
This project is funded by an MRC-NIHR Methodology Research Panel award, and seeks to investigate and develop statistical methodology for developing and validating clinical prediction models (CPMs) 
for predicting multiple outcomes simultaneously. CPMs are models or algorithms which take a collection of a patients characteristics (e.g age, blood pressure, family disease history) and produces an 
output of the likelihood of an event happening, for example the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The majority of CPMs available are only designed to calculate a patients risk for one particular disease. 
This project aims to model a whole patient pathway and predict the likelihood of someone developing multiple outcomes simultaneously, using one CPM.
